This is a template example for lab journaling. Students in Matt Crump's Human Cognition and Performance Lab will use this template to learn R, and other things. Students can replace this text with more fun things. People not in my lab can use this too.

## My plans

1. 3 to 5 years: Sustaining a research grant and running independent studies related to my PhD work 
- Learn how to write a compelling grant proposal 
-	Read and research about the latest techniques in the field of agriculture biodiversity studies 

2. 1 year: Successfully complete the PhD qualifying examination 
-	Draft a well-researched proposal 
-	Prepare for questions that may be asked about the study by reading and preparing references to cite
